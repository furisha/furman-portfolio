            <h1 class="section-heading">About Me</h1>
            <div class="about">   
                <p>My first IT carrer job was QA automation tester. Project that I mostly worked on was <b>in-house</b> project.</p>
                <p>The basis of the application we developed was to get/convert a large amount of data and helps drive competitive advantage with predictive QA visual analytics and dashboards across popular application lifecycle management software testing tools such as: JIRA, Microsoft Excel, Tricentis Tosca , Spira Test, Sonarqube, Tasktop. In short, the application helps <b>deliver</b> software <b>on time</b> with <b>less risk</b></p>
                <p>The methodology we used during software development was <b>Agile-Scrum</b>. We were guided by <b>sprints</b> that lasted 1 or 2 weeks with all ceremonies included.</p>
                <p>Application was based on <b>PhP, React.js and Angular.js</b>, and we perform end-to-end testing using Tosca testing tool, which is btw a great tool.</p>
                <p>Working on this project required knowledge of: <b>GIT</b> version control service, CI tools like <b>Jenkins</b>, PM tool like <b>JIRA</b> and <b>Tosca</b> software testing tool as well.</p> 
                <p>The main types of testing we used during development were: <b>Functional, UI, Regression and E2E</b>.
                <p>During the work on the project, I became well acquainted with terms such as <b>STLC, Agile/Scrum Methodology</b>, and also what is a <b>team spirit</b>, <b>team management</b>, <b>how to maintenance</b> and <b>create test suites</b> and <b>test cases</b> according to the <b>requiremants and specifications</b> and much more.</p>
                <p>I became very <b>interested in test automation</b> and the problem I saw after couple of years was working in a huge team and limitation of using only one testing tool. This limitation led me to research and learn how to use as many testing tools as possible and to recognize myself in a particular programming language.</p>
                <p>One of the biggest <b>adventages</b> of test automation is that gives a huge <b>confidence</b> to the whole development <b>team</b> and <b>shorten the time</b> of QA's for regression or e2e testing of complex and large applications.</p>
                <p>My learning stages were mostly <b>in step</b> with the <b>needs</b> of the <b>clients</b>, but I used to have complete freedom of choice which technology and tools to use for automation testig.</p>
                <p>At the beginning, I decided to focus my learning on <b>JS</b> and <b>OOP</b> concepts. After I mastered a <b>Cypress</b> testing tool where I learned what <b>Page Object Model</b> is and how and when POM is good or bad to be used, how to intercept an <b>API</b> requests and assert results, and basically all the features which this tool adorns.</p>                   
                <p>Afterwords comes <b>Java, Pyhon, Selenium</b> and <b>BDD</b> with <b>Gherkin</b> language as well.</p>                 
                <p><b>Cypress</b> was the starter because its open source, legerity of use, simple for understanding automation process and debugging, intercepting API requests, coding, reporting, and other cool features.</p>
                <p>Until now I worked on several different projects. Projects and applications varied from <b>outsourced</b> to <b>in-house</b> products. So far I have worked on about 10 different projects that were quite different if take into account their management, methodologies and testing aproaches used during development phases.</p>
                <p>The <b>customers</b> I saved from bugs and secured from security breaches in production were mostly MAC/WIN OS oriented.</p>
                <p>So far I have worked on the development of various applications related to: <b>medicine</b>, <b>management</b>, <b>recruitment</b>, <b>matching</b>, <b>entertainment</b>, <b>forms</b>, etc.</p>
                <p>I am currently a <b>QA team leader</b> of two QA warriors, with whom I am working on a project based on <b>Django, Python and MySql</b>. QA tests are written in <b>Selenium</b> using <b>PyTest</b> and implemented in the continuous integration process.</p>
                <p>I found myself more efficency when work <b>remotely</b> within smaller and <b>quieter environment</b> where I can get better <b>focus</b>.</p>

            <h1 class="section-heading">Skills</h1>
            <div class="skills">
                <p>It is very important for each person in the team to have a <b>well-balanced skill set</b>. I am happy to elevate  my skills and I think that a good balance of skills affects the productivity of everyone in the team, which can be reflected in the product itself.</p>         
                <p>I know how to <b>explan the nature of defects</b> with detailed description. Always willing to <b>initiate</b> changes in QA and development process if spot bottleneck in process.</p>
                <p>I have a good <b>analytical</b> skills and abilities to <b>collect and process informations</b> and good <b>communication</b> skills as well.</p>
                <p>I'm trying to have a full <b>focus on the problem</b> with good <b>attention to details</b>. It's not always ease to find the spirit of the customers paths, and the <b>spirit of the bugs and defects</b> itself.</p>
                <p>Im' tying to set good balance between quality and speed of product delivery which leads to good organization using small amount of time counters and resources for problem solving.</p>
                <p>I always strive to <b>simplify</b> complex situations and to get the job finish in the most <b>effective</b> and <b>creative</b> way and <b>on time</b>.</p>
                <p>I prefer <b>close coopeation</b> with developers and stakeholders for better prepering and undestanding the issues. I prefer  working in <b>smaller teams</b> which has a better communication and higher productivity in my opinion.</p>
                <p>I am a <b>diligent</b> and <b>patient</b> person. Always <b>ready to learn</b> something new and to <b>improve myself</b> and <b>share knowledge</b>. I've watched a lot of tutorials and I'm doing my own development through Udemy course platform, where I've earned numerous certificates and additional knowledge for self-upgrade. I am most interested in courses related to automatic testing, but also in front and back-end programming languages such as javascript, python and java as well.</p>               
                <p>I'm trying to be <b>commitment</b> as more as I can and to <b>adjust</b> easier to upcomming, unavoidable <b>technology changes</b>. I was born early 80's so I understand very well what kind of growth IT technology has had during its development since its early beginnings.</p>               
                <P>I remember how I used to use an analog phone and, as a child, disassembled a mechanical watch and studied its parts. But I also remember my first Commodore with a cassette and martix/or mechanical printers and how that sounds, as well as the buzzing of old modems when connecting to the network. My family was MS Windows (I think i have DOS and MS Windows 3.11 on floppy disks somwere on the bassement) oriented so as a child I didn't has a chance to choose between Amiga or Macintosh e.g.</P>
                <P>I think I am capable of <b>creating a test environment</b> in any of the most popular programming languages such as <b>python, javascript or java</b>. Also, to set the framework from the dust on newly created environment.</P>
                <p>I love startup in-house projects and when I am involved in from the beginning.</p>
                <p>I love working in <b>elaxed atmosphere</b>r with funny guys in a team.</p>
